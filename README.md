Doing one CTF challenge a day until I land an internship

# 🛡️ DailyCTF — My Cybersecurity Practice Journey

Welcome to my DailyCTF repo, where I document my journey through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. This repo serves as a record of what I’ve learned, how I approached each problem, and how I’m improving over time in areas like web security, cryptography, reverse engineering, and more.

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen real-world cybersecurity skills
- Build intuition around exploitation and defense
- Stay consistent with daily or weekly challenge solving
- Showcase practical experience for internship and job readiness

## 📂 Structure
Each folder contains:
- `README.md` write-up for the challenge
- Any provided source code, scripts, or payloads
- Screenshots or notes (when helpful)
