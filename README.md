# 🧠 dailyCTF — My Journey to Red Teaming

Hi, I’m **Justin Reginald Tan** — a senior CIS student passionate about red teaming and web application security.

I created `dailyCTF` to push myself to solve **one Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge every day**, build consistency, and grow as an offensive security learner. When I started, I could barely solve the easiest challenges without help. And to be honest, there are still days I feel completely lost. I question whether I’m making real progress or just pretending to know what I’m doing.

But I keep showing up. Not because I have it all figured out, but because I believe growth comes from showing up when it’s hardest. This repo is my way of holding myself accountable and learning in public — even when it’s messy.

## 🔍 Why I’m Doing This

CTFs challenge the way I think. They’re not just technical puzzles — they’re hands-on reps that help me:

- Practice real-world concepts like **web exploitation**, **privilege escalation**, and **enumeration**
- Build the discipline to keep going, even on rough days
- Prepare for the **OSCP**, one step at a time
- Think like an attacker, not just a student

This project is more than flag captures — it’s about staying curious, consistent, and uncomfortable enough to grow.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

Each challenge folder includes:

- ✅ A short summary of the vulnerability or concept  
- 💡 Key takeaways and what I struggled with or improved  
- 🧪 Tools, payloads, and commands used  
- 📸 Terminal output and screenshots (when helpful)

You'll also find occasional write-ups on:

- Web app exploitation tips  
- Enumeration strategies  
- Personal reflections on mindset and progress  
- Notes from my OSCP prep

## ⚠️ Note

This is a work in progress, just like me. I’ve missed days, taken breaks, and some of these write-ups are rough — but that’s part of the process. I’m not aiming for perfect. I’m aiming to improve. What matters is that I keep coming back.

DailyCTF is about daily cybersecurity learning through practical challenges. Occasionally, I include select labs from structured training like HackTheBox's CPTS Course, as they reinforce and deepen the same practical skills developed in CTFs.

If you’re learning too, or feeling stuck somewhere in your journey, I hope this repo reminds you that showing up still counts.

Feel free to star ⭐ the repo, follow along, or share thoughts. Especially if you're on the red team path. I’d love to connect.
