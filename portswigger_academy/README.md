# PortSwigger Academy Track

*Part of my **DailyCTF** journey*

I was debating to include this section into my DailyCTF, but thought it was relevant enough to warrant the inclusion. Alot of my CTFs I take on are web app related, and I've had to learn the ins and out of burp-suite and have been learning through PortSwigger Academy concurrently.
