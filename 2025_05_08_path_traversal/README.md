## Path Traversals
**Date completed**: 2025-05-08

No I missed two days on my CTF Streak :(. It's okay we continue forward! Starting the streak again. CTFs were getting exponentially more difficult, so I'm starting portswigger's academy lessons/labs on common web vulnerabilities using BurpSuite. This will help me with future CTFs, as well as enhance my overall cybersecurity knowledge.

### Goal

Understand the basic path traversal vulnerabilities.

### Key concepts
- Absolute Path Bypass
- Null Bytes
- Traversal Tokens

#### URL Encoding Quick Notes

Overlapping tokens such as `....//` survive a single-pass filter that strips only the first `../`.*
| What you send     | 1st URL-decode step | 2nd URL-decode step | Meaning                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `%2e%2e%2f`       | `../`               | (no change)         | `../` (*single-encoded*) |
| `%252e%252e%252f` | `%2e%2e%2f`         | `../`               | `../` (*double-encoded*) |


### Example to Remember

1. Browse to **Product image** endpoint and intercept the request  
   `GET /image?filename=45.jpg`
2. Replace the `filename` value with  
3. Forward the request and observe the server returning the contents of `/etc/passwd`.

```http
GET /image?filename=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc/passwd HTTP/2
```


### Ways to Protect Against Path Traversal

#### Two Main Methods
1. Validate the user input before processing it. Ideally, compare the user input with a whitelist of permitted values. If that isn't possible, verify that the input contains only permitted content, such as alphanumeric characters only.
2. After validating the supplied input, append the input to the base directory and use a platform filesystem API to canonicalize the path. Verify that the canonicalized path starts with the expected base directory
