## Summary

Brute-force the SNMP community string on 10.129.14.128 then identify the custom agent version.

## Reconnaissance & Enumeration

Commands

```bash
# 1. Find community string
onesixtyone -c /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128

# 2. Probe system group for metadata
braa public@10.129.14.128:.1.3.6.*
```

Output

```bash
# onesixtyone
10.129.14.128 [public] Linux htb 5.11.0-37-generic â€¦

# braa
â€¦:sysName   : htb
â€¦:sysLocation: InFreight SNMP v0.91

```

It shows the default public community string is valid, and revealed the custom SNMP agent version for me. These were what was required in the lab.

## Takeaways & Lessons Learned

Learned more networking fundamentals through this lab. It was important to understand how SNMP works, what OID and MIB tells about a system.
